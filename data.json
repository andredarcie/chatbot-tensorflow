But, how might one do this?\n\nUPDATE 8\/04\/2008 00:21:01 EST:\n\nThat looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a true method.\n\nYour example defines the new patch function with an argument of self, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named self (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call class.patch(obj) instead of just class.patch() if you want the same functionality as a true method.\n\nIt looks like Python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function (and as such is callable).

The decorator return a (third) function calling automatically the copied function, giving the instance as the first parameter.\n  <br\/>\n  <br\/>\nIn conclusion you get a function simulating it's binding to the class instance. Letting the original function unchanged.<\/p>\n",

Tuples are mostly used in order to return more than one value from a function.

                "<p>My recommendation would be to figure out a set of known input-output results, such as some simpler cases that you already have in place, and <em>unit test the code that is produced<\/em>. It's entirely possible that as you change the generator that the exact string that is produced may be slightly different... but what you really care is whether it is interpreted in the same way. Thus, if you test the results as you would test that code if it were your feature, you will find out if it succeeds in the ways you want.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, what you really want to know is whether your generator will produce what you expect without physically testing every possible combination (also: impossible). By ensuring that your generator is consistent in the ways you expect, you can feel better that the generator will succeed in ever-more-complex situations.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this way, you can also build up a suite of regression tests (unit tests that need to keep working correctly). This will help you make sure that changes to your generator aren't breaking other forms of code. When you encounter a bug that your unit tests didn't catch, you may want to include it to prevent similar breakage.<\/p>\n",
                "<p>I find that you need to test what you're generating more than how you generate it.<\/p>\n\n<p>In my case, the program generates many types of code (C#, HTML, SCSS, JS, etc.) that compile into a web application. The best way I've found to reduce regression bugs overall is to test the web application itself, not by testing the generator.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Don't get me wrong, there are still unit tests checking out some of the generator code, but our biggest bang for our buck has been UI tests on the generated app itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since we're generating it we also generate a nice abstraction in JS we can use to programatically test the app. We followed some ideas outlined here: <a href=\"http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/articles\/maintainable-automated-ui-tests--net-35089\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/code.tutsplus.com\/articles\/maintainable-automated-ui-tests--net-35089<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The great part is that it really tests your system end-to-end, from code generation out to what you're actually generating.

Again you would need a shell script or whatnot to run this for each input.

It's not just semantics... there are different mindsets, approaches, expectations, etc.  It's certainly more work, but you probably need to bite the bullet and set up an end-to-end regression test suite: fixed C++ files -> SWIG interfaces -> python modules -> known output.  You really want to check the known input (fixed C++ code) against expected output (what comes out of the final Python program).

                "<p>Finally a question that I can really put a value answer to :). <\/p>\n\n<p>I have investigated f2py, boost.python, swig, cython and pyrex for my work (PhD in optical measurement techniques). I used swig extensively, boost.python some and pyrex and cython a lot. I also used ctypes. This is my breakdown:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer<\/strong>: This is my personal experience. I am not involved with any of these projects. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>swig:<\/strong>\ndoes not play well with c++. It should, but name mangling problems in the linking step was a major headache for me on linux &amp; Mac OS X. If you have C code and want it interfaced to python, it is a good solution. I wrapped the GTS for my needs and needed to write basically a C shared library which I could connect to. I would not recommend it.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ctypes:<\/strong>\nI wrote a libdc1394 (IEEE Camera library) wrapper using ctypes and it was a very straigtforward experience. You can find the code on <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/pydc1394\">https:\/\/launchpad.net\/pydc1394<\/a>. It is a lot of work to convert headers to python code, but then everything works reliably. This is a good way if you want to interface an external library. Ctypes is also in the stdlib of python, so everyone can use your code right away. This is also a good way to play around with a new lib in python quickly. I can recommend it to interface to external libs. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Boost.Python<\/strong>: Very enjoyable. If you already have C++ code of your own that you want to use in python, go for this. It is very easy to translate c++ class structures into python class structures this way. I recommend it if you have c++ code that you need in python. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Pyrex\/Cython:<\/strong> Use Cython, not Pyrex. Period. Cython is more advanced and more enjoyable to use. Nowadays, I do everything with cython that i used to do with SWIG or Ctypes. It is also the best way if you have python code that runs too slow. The process is absolutely fantastic: you convert your python modules into cython modules, build them and keep profiling and optimizing like it still was python (no change of tools needed). You can then apply as much (or as little) C code mixed with your python code. This is by far faster then having to rewrite whole parts of your application in C; you only rewrite the inner loop. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Timings<\/strong>: ctypes has the highest call overhead (~700ns), followed by boost.python (322ns), then directly by swig (290ns). Cython has the lowest call overhead (124ns) and the best feedback where it spends time on (cProfile support!). The numbers are from my box calling a trivial function that returns an integer from an interactive shell; module import overhead is therefore not timed, only function call overhead is. It is therefore easiest and most productive to get python code fast by profiling and using cython.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary<\/strong>: For your problem, use Cython ;). I hope this rundown will be useful for some people. I'll gladly answer any remaining question.<\/p>\n\n<p><hr \/><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit<\/strong>: I forget to mention: for numerical purposes (that is, connection to NumPy) use Cython; they have support for it (because they basically develop cython for this purpose). So this should be another +1 for your decision. <\/p>\n"

My suggestion would be to encourage them to develop in python, but not the mission critical parts of the app. Instead they could write some utility scripts, some small internal application that needs doing, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>In conclusion: I don't recommend switching from PHP, but I do recommend accommodating the developer's interest in some way at work.<\/p>\n",

                "<p>I recently introduced Python to my company, which does consulting work for the Post Office.  I did this by waiting until there was a project for which I would be the only programmer, then getting permission to do this new project in Python.  I then did another small project in Python with similarly impressive results.  In addition, I used Python for all of my small throwaway assignments (\"can you parse the stats in these files into a CSV file organized by date and site?\", etc) and had a quick turnaround time on all of them.<\/p>\n\n<p>I also evangelized Python a bit; I went out of my way to NOT be obnoxious about it, but I'd occasionally describe why I liked it so much, talked about the personal projects I use it for in my free time and why it's awesome for me, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Eventually we started another project and I convinced everyone to use Python for it.  I took care to point everyone to a lot of documentation, including the specific webpages relating to what they were working on, and every time they had a question, I'd explain how to do things properly by explaining the Pythonic approach to things, etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>This has worked really well.  However, this might be somewhat different than what you're describing.  In my case I started with moderately small projects and Python is only being used for new projects.  Also, none of my co-workers were really Perl or PHP gurus; they all knew those languages and had been using them for awhile, but it didn't take much effort for them to become more productive in Python than they'd been before.<\/p>\n\n<p>So if you're talking about new projects with people who currently use PHP but aren't super-experts and don't love that language, then I think switching to Python is a no-brainer.  However, if you're talking about working with a large existing PHP code base with a lot of very experienced PHP programmers who are happy with their current setup, then switching languages is probably not a good idea.  You're probably somewhere in between, so you'll have to weigh the tradeoffs; hopefully my answer will help you do that.<\/p>\n"

It is also self-documenting in that you declare the help argument (which will be used when run with -h\/--help) right there with the option.<\/p>\n\n<p>Usually you parse your arguments with:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>options, args = parser.parse_args()\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>This will, by default, parse the standard arguments passed to the script (sys.argv[1:])<\/p>\n\n<p>options.query will then be set to the value you passed to the script.<\/p>\n\n<p>You create a parser simply by doing<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>parser = optparse.OptionParser()\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>These are all the basics you need.  Here's a complete Python script that shows this:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>import optparse\n\nparser = optparse.OptionParser()\n\nparser.add_option('-q', '--query',\n    action=\"store\", dest=\"query\",\n    help=\"query string\", default=\"spam\")\n\noptions, args = parser.parse_args()\n\nprint 'Query string:', options.query\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>5 lines of python that show you the basics.<\/p>\n\n<p>Save it in sample.py, and run it once with<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>python sample.py\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>and once with<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>python sample.py --query myquery\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Beyond that, you will find that optparse is very easy to extend.\nIn one of my projects, I created a Command class which allows you to nest subcommands in a command tree easily.

Another drawback of the way Java does GC is that you have to tell the jvm what heap size you want (if the default is not good enough); the JVM derives from that value several thresholds that will trigger the GC process when there is too much garbage stacking up in the heap.<\/p>\n\n<p>I presume that this is actually the main cause of the jerky feeling of Android (based on Java), even on the most expensive cellphones, in comparison with the smoothness of iOS (based on ObjectiveC, and using RC). <\/p>\n\n<p>I'd love to see a jvm option to enable RC memory management, and maybe keeping GC only to run as a last resort when there is no more memory left. <\/p>\n",

                "<p>Garbage collection is faster (more time efficient) than reference counting, if you have enough memory. For example, a copying gc traverses the \"live\" objects and copies them to a new space, and can reclaim all the \"dead\" objects in one step by marking a whole memory region. This is very efficient, <em>if<\/em> you have enough memory. Generational collections use the knowledge that \"most objects die young\"; often only a few percent of objects have to be copied.<\/p>\n\n<p>[This is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc\/free]<\/p>\n\n<p>Reference counting is much more space efficient than garbage collection, since it reclaims memory the very moment it gets unreachable. This is nice when you want to attach finalizers to objects (e.g. to close a file once the File object gets unreachable). A reference counting system can work even when only a few percent of the memory is free. But the management cost of having to increment and decrement counters upon each pointer assignment cost a lot of time, and some kind of garbage collection is still needed to reclaim cycles.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the trade-off is clear: if you have to work in a memory-constrained environment, or if you need precise finalizers, use reference counting.

                "<p>Darren Thomas gives a good answer.  However, one big difference between the Java and Python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case (no circular references) objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, I can write sloppy, non-portable code in CPython such as<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>def parse_some_attrs(fname):\n    return open(fname).read().split(\"~~~\")[2:4]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>and the file descriptor for that file I opened will be cleaned up immediately because as soon as the reference to the open file goes away, the file is garbage collected and the file descriptor is freed.  Of course, if I run Jython or IronPython or possibly PyPy, then the garbage collector won't necessarily run until much later; possibly I'll run out of file descriptors first and my program will crash.<\/p>\n\n<p>So you SHOULD be writing code that looks like<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>def parse_some_attrs(fname):\n    with open(fname) as f:\n        return f.read().split(\"~~~\")[2:4]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>but sometimes people like to rely on reference counting to always free up their resources because it can sometimes make your code a little shorter.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'd say that the best garbage collector is the one with the best performance, which currently seems to be the Java-style generational garbage collectors that can run in a separate thread and has all these crazy optimizations, etc.  The differences to how you write your code should be negligible and ideally non-existent.<\/p>\n",
                "<p>Actually reference counting and the strategies used by the Sun JVM are all different types of garbage collection algorithms.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are two broad approaches for tracking down dead objects: tracing and reference counting. In tracing the GC starts from the \"roots\" - things like stack references, and traces all reachable (live) objects. Anything that can't be reached is considered dead. In reference counting each time a reference is modified the object's involved have their count updated. Any object whose reference count gets set to zero is considered dead.<\/p>\n\n<p>With basically all GC implementations there are trade offs but tracing is usually good for high through put (i.e. fast) operation but has longer pause times (larger gaps where the UI or program may freeze up). Reference counting can operate in smaller chunks but will be slower overall. It may mean less freezes but poorer performance overall.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally a reference counting GC requires a cycle detector to clean up any objects in a cycle that won't be caught by their reference count alone. Perl 5 didn't have a cycle detector in its GC implementation and could leak memory that was cyclic.<\/p>\n\n<p>Research has also been done to get the best of both worlds (low pause times, high throughput):\n<a href=\"http:\/\/cs.anu.edu.au\/~Steve.Blackburn\/pubs\/papers\/urc-oopsla-2003.pdf\">http:\/\/cs.anu.edu.au\/~Steve.Blackburn\/pubs\/papers\/urc-oopsla-2003.pdf<\/a><\/p>\n",
                "<p>There are drawbacks of using reference counting. One of the most mentioned is circular references: Suppose A references B, B references C and C references B. If A were to drop its reference to B, both B and C will still have a reference count of 1 and won't be deleted with traditional reference counting. CPython (reference counting is not part of python itself, but part of the C implementation thereof) catches circular references with a separate garbage collection routine that it runs periodically...<\/p>\n\n<p>Another drawback: Reference counting can make execution slower. Each time an object is referenced and dereferenced, the interpreter\/VM must check to see if the count has gone down to 0 (and then deallocate if it did). Garbage Collection does not need to do this.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, Garbage Collection can be done in a separate thread (though it can be a bit tricky). On machines with lots of RAM and for processes that use memory only slowly, you might not want to be doing GC at all!

                "<p>I'm not familiar with the specific services listed, but the field of natural language processing has developed a number of techniques that enable this sort of information extraction from general text.  As Sean stated, once you have candidate terms, it's not to difficult to search for those terms with some of the other entities in context and then use the results of that search to determine how confident you are that the term extracted is an actual entity of interest.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/opennlp.sourceforge.net\/\">OpenNLP<\/a> is a great project if you'd like to play around with natural language processing.  The capabilities you've named would probably be best accomplished with Named Entity Recognizers (NER) (algorithms that locate proper nouns, generally, and sometimes dates as well) and\/or Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (eg: the word 'bank' has different meanings depending on it's context, and that can be very important when extracting information from text.  Given the sentences: \"the plane banked left\", \"the snow bank was high\", and \"they robbed the bank\" you can see how dissambiguation can play an important part in language understanding)<\/p>\n\n<p>Techniques generally build on each other, and NER is one of the more complex tasks, so to do NER successfully, you will generally need accurate tokenizers (natural language tokenizers, mind you -- statistical approaches tend to fare the best), string stemmers (algorithms that conflate similar words to common roots: so words like informant and informer are treated equally), sentence detection ('Mr. Jones was tall.' is only one sentence, so you can't just check for punctuation), part-of-speech taggers (POS taggers), and WSD.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a python port of (parts of) OpenNLP called NLTK (<a href=\"http:\/\/nltk.sourceforge.net\">http:\/\/nltk.sourceforge.net<\/a>) but I don't have much experience with it yet.  Most of my work has been with the Java and C# ports, which work well.  <\/p>\n\n<p>All of these algorithms are language-specific, of course, and they can take significant time to run (although, it is generally faster than reading the material you are processing).  Since the state-of-the-art is largely based on statistical techniques, there is also a considerable error rate to take into account.  Furthermore, because the error rate impacts all the stages, and something like NER requires numerous stages of processing, (tokenize -> sentence detect -> POS tag -> WSD -> NER) the error rates compound.<\/p>\n",

Entity Extraction, Named Entity Recognition). For that purpose we have a sophisticated rule-based system that combines discovery rules as well as lexicons\/dictionaries. This combination allows us to identify names of companies\/persons\/films, etc., even if they don't exist in any available list.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the most prominent entities (such as people, companies) we also perform anaphora resolution, cross-reference and name canonization\/normalization at the article level, so we'll know that 'John Smith' and 'Mr. Smith', for example, are likely referring to the same person.\nSo the short answer to your question is - no, it's not just about matching against large databases.<\/p>\n\n<p>Events\/Facts are really interesting because they take our discovery rules one level deeper; we find relations between entities and label them with the appropriate type, for example M&amp;As (relations between two or more companies), Employment Changes (relations between companies and people), and so on. Needless to say, Event\/Fact extraction is not possible for systems that are based solely on lexicons.\nFor the most part, our system is tuned to be precision-oriented, but we always try to keep a reasonable balance between accuracy and entirety.<\/p>\n\n<p>By the way there are some cool new metadata capabilities coming out later this month so stay tuned.<\/p>\n\n<p>Regards,<\/p>\n\n<p>Michal<\/p>\n"

Otherwise, that would probably be the best solution. ODBC is turning out to be extremely difficult to even get working. There is absolutely zero feedback from FM when you set it up so you have to dig through \/var\/log\/system.log and parse obscure error messages.\n\nConclusion: I got it working by running a python script locally on the machine that queries the FM database through the ODBC connections. The script is actually a TCPServer that accepts socket connections from other systems on the LAN, runs the queries, and returns the data through the socket connection.

With Python every UI library has at's own semantics which are often at odds with the pythonic mindset in which you are trying to write your program. I am not blaming the library writers. I've tried several libraries (wxwidgets, PythonWin[Wrapper around MFC], Tkinter), When doing so I often felt that I was writing code in a language other than Python (despite the fact that it was python) because the libraries aren't exactly pythonic they are a port from another language be it c, c++, tk.<\/p>\n\n<p>So  for me I will write UI code in .NET (for me C#) because of the IDE &amp; the consistency of the libraries.

(There's far less idioms required to be involved in writing good Python code than in writing good C++.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Given this, most Python (CPython) programmers ascribe to the \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\" philosophy. By writing high-level (and significantly slower) Python code, one can optimize the bottlenecks out using C\/C++ bindings when your application is nearing completion. At this point it becomes more clear what your processor-intensive algorithms are through proper profiling. This way, you write most of the code in a very readable and maintainable manner while allowing for speedups down the road.

                "<p>I really like python, it's usually my language of choice these days for small (non-gui) stuff that I do on my own.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, for some larger Python projects I've tackled, I'm finding that it's not quite the same as programming in say, C++. I was working on a language parser, and needed to represent an AST in Python. This is certainly within the scope of what Python can do, but I had a bit of trouble with some refactoring. I was changing the representation of my AST and changing methods and classes around a lot, and I found I missed the strong typing that would be available to me in a C++ solution. Python's duck typing was almost <em>too<\/em> flexible and I found myself adding a lot of <code>assert<\/code> code to try to check my types as the program ran. And then I couldn't really be sure that everything was properly typed unless I had 100% code coverage testing (which I didn't at the time).<\/p>\n\n<p>Actually, that's another thing that I miss sometimes. It's possible to write syntactically correct code in Python that simply won't run. The compiler is incapable of telling you about it until it actually executes the code, so in infrequently-used code paths such as error handlers you can easily have unseen bugs lurking around. Even code that's as simple as printing an error message with a % format string can fail at runtime because of mismatched types.<\/p>\n\n<p>I haven't used Python for any GUI stuff so I can't comment on that aspect.<\/p>\n",

If you have 5 or less people and the target size is roughly Stack Overflow, go ahead, write in Python. You will finish in no time and be happy with good codebase. But if you want to write second Google or Yahoo, you will be much better with C# or Java.<\/p>\n\n<p>Side-note on C\/C++ you have mentioned: if you are not writing performance critical software (say massive parallel raytracer that will run for three months rendering a film) or a very mission critical system (say Mars lander that will fly three years straight and has only one chance to land right or you lose $400mln) do not use it.

Preferably something that would work on multiple operating systems\/shells but in particular for bash.\n\nI'm currently doing the following, but am sure there must be a library function for this, or at least a more elegant\/robust\/efficient option:\n\ndef sh_escape(s):\n   return s.replace(\"(\",\"\\\\(\").replace(\")\",\"\\\\)\").replace(\" \",\"\\\\ \")\n\nos.system(\"cat %s | grep something | sort > %s\" \n          % (sh_escape(in_filename), \n             sh_escape(out_filename)))\n\n\nEdit: I've accepted the simple answer of using quotes, don't know why I didn't think of that; I guess because I came from Windows where ' and \" behave a little differently.\n\nRegarding security, I understand the concern, but, in this case, I'm interested in a quick and easy solution which os.system() provides, and the source of the strings is either not user-generated or at least entered by a trusted user (me).\n"
